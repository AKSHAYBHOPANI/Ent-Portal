# Ent-Portal
A local deployed portal with all documents you need in a central repository, Useful tools and shared updated experiences among everyone.It uses latest HTML 5 and Jquery for its implementation. Hosted locally in Shared Folder and only accessible inside office premises or through VPN. We call it “DAILY ESSENTIALS WEB”.

Dear Team,

 

Daily Essentials Sheet was one of the popular document among agents. This was not expected but surprisingly 80% of agents started using that document. That was most asked document after Link Updated. I realized people were using it as a tool rather than just a sheet of document because it was having useful information in one place. So I thought let’s take it to the next level and make a real tool that everyone can use and streamline the workflow.

 

So Introducing Enterprise Portal,

Features

 

Documents at your Finger Tips

Be it latest Link Updated, On Time, 1st Mail Template or any other useful document all available to download or directly open (File Stream) inside the portal. Everything secured and updated through central repository experiences.

 

Telnet From Browser

Kitty is a nice tool but slower and never updated. While now you can directly telnet through your browser and with all updated core router links. The portal directly connects to Microsoft telnet Client and is less haggy on resources.

 

TT Master

This is a personal To Do List and TT organizing app. Now you can save and arrange all pop down details or any other CRM/NOC TT details. You can drag and organize any TT you are working on and streamline your workflow. All details are saved in your local browser and available to you until next reboot. It used HTML 5  localStorage attribute to make this happen.

 

Links and Tools

 

![Tools](https://github.com/AKSHAYBHOPANI/Ent-Portal/blob/master/image014.jpg)

That’s not all. There is more features and tools that you will explore using it.  This is just start of a foundation that we built with this portal. The possibilities are limitless and experience will improve day by day. I will keep this Portal and Daily Essentials Sheet updated regularly.
